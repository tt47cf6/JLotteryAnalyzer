# JLotteryAnalyzer
A simple lottery analyzer tool.

Let me get this straight right off the bat: I don't believe this program will make you win every Lottery drawing from here on out. In the midst of developing this project, I came to understand just how incredible the odds are. 

None the less, this program will update with the most recent drawings online and show you the most common and uncommon numbers by percentage. 

I wrote this application not to win the lotto, but rather to challenge myself as I developed my programming skills.

# Application Structure
This application scrapes a website to gather the most recent winning numbers, the date of the drawing, whether somebody won the jackpot, and how much was paid out in total. 
This wealth of information is saved in text files between uses. 

Many options are available for you to specify how the program should tally and compute numbers.
